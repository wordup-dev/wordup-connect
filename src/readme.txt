This WordPress plugin connects your WordPress installation with your local wordup CLI.

== Description ==

Wordup CLI is an open-source development toolkit for setting up and managing your local WordPress Theme/Plugin development, so that you can totally focus on coding.
If you want to setup your local WordPress development stack, you can use this plugin to download automatically a backup of your public WordPress website. 
Use wordup-connect for:

* Testing your public website on a local development server
* Develop new plugins or themes based on an existing website
* Export your new project and install it on a remote server

See [wordup.dev](https://wordup.dev) for more details.

Wordup Connect uses updraftplus for backups.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugins zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress website. 
Or download and activate the plugin directly through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
